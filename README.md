# dom.js

A really simple and small JavaScript library for working with the DOM.
The syntax is heavily inspired by jQuery so most things should be familiar.

The primary focus of dom.js is a small footprint. The main focus is not browser support, however there shouldn't be any problems in the latest versions of all major browsers.

# Tests

Tests are found in the /tests/ directory.
